    //Strings, numbers and booleans are copied

    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name1 = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name1;

    console.log(name1, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players //this does not make a copy & just references the original array
    console.log(team, players);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(team, players);
 
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const players2 = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team2 = players.slice();

    team2[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(team2, players2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    team3 = [].concat(players2);
    team3[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(team3, players2);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players2];
    team4[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(team4, players2);

    //or use Array.from
    const team5 = Array.from(players2);
    team5[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(team5, players2);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person2 = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});
    console.log(captain2, person2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
